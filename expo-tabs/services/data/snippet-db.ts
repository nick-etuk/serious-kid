                    This refers to the amount of volcanic activity. “Active” means there’s regular activity, “dormant” means there’s been recent activity, but the volcano is currently quiet, and “extinct” means it’s been so long since the last eruption that it’s unlikely to ever erupt again.

                    Mantle plumes are super-hot areas of rock inside the Earth!
                    Volcanoes don't just occur on land.
                    They can be found on the ocean floor and under ice caps, too!
                    Volcanoes exist throughout the solar system!
                    Other planets and moons have volcanoes, too.`
